This is an Alien Invasion game following the base code provided in Python Crash Course 3rd edition. Alien Invasion involves a moving fleet of aliens that descend the screen, in which you control a ship that fires bullets to eliminate them. If the alien makes contact with the ship or the bottom of the screen, the game over function is called.

This version of Alien Invasion uses Object Oriented Programming, creating and using several classes that are applied in the main code.

Images used in the code were taken directly from the website via the provided links in the text.

Additions made by myself include the window variables, bullet speed, and visual changes (i.e, colors).
